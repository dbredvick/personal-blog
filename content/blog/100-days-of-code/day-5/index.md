**Today's Progress**:

- Updated my GatsbyJS site with an about me page. I learned a little bit of GraphQL in the process.
- Published the new site to AWS Amplify

**Thoughts:**
GraphQL looks nice so far! I'd like to get it into a little heavier of an application and see if I like it in that scenario. Right now though, it's great with GatsbyJS.
