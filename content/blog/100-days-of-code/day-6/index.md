**Today's Progress**:

- Tried to switch DNS for my Google domain to work with my S3 bucket on AWS. Steuggled with this for quite awhile.

**Thoughts:**
I'm considering deploying on Google just so that the domain will play nicer with the assets.

**Link to work:**

- No link today - I just struggled with DNS/AWS/Google.
