**Today's Progress**:

- Found API with data I'm going to use for the project. I'm not interested in maintaining an up-to-date registry of all the podcasts on the web. [ListenNotes](https://market.mashape.com/listennotes/listennotes) was the clear winner here. It's also freemium-based :smiley:
- Did research on which starter project I'd like to use. Considering [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gastby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
- Researching what I'm going to use for the back end. Considering [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/), and also considering [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).
- After doing all the tech research, I realized I needed to have a clearer idea of what exactly I'm building. That way I can pick the tech that fits the problem.
- I decided I want to blog all of this and document it along the way. I was typing notes this whole time in Evernote - why not publish it? I need to decide if I'm going the Medium/LinkedIn approach or running my own with GastbyJS. This feels like an awesome opportunity to try out Gastby.
- Okay so I'm hosting my own. I bought a domain too :smiley:

**Thoughts:**
It's really easy to go longer than an hour after just getting started. I think that's going to be the key to this.
