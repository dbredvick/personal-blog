**Today's Progress**:

- I wrote a page on my blog for 100-days-of-code so that I can track progress there as well.
- Wrote some GraphQL queries to setup a new section for posts under the 100-days-of-code page. This is the **Daily Updates** section.

**Thoughts:**
I am really liking this JAM stack idea. I think it will work really well for content heavy sites.
