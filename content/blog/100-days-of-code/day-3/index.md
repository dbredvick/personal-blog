**Today's Progress**:

- Updated my GatsbyJS site to actually use their blog starter. Then updated the blog with a intro post from me, used my pictures, etc.

**Thoughts:**
GatsbyJS is super nice. I think I see a lot of potential for smaller & bigger applications using this tech.

**Link to work:**

- Still need to publish this
- Here's an image though
