I recently started listening to Seth Godin's podcast, [Akimbo](https://www.akimbo.me/). It's very well done and has thought-provoking points. One of my favorite episodes, "No such thing (as writer's block)", really illustrates the point of why I'm doing the challenge.

> There's no plumber's block. There's no ditch-digger's block. There's no Lyft driver's block.
> Why do writers and creatives get this magic, special exception?
> What we're really saying is 'I don't have any ideas that are perfectly formed'.

Seth mentions that our problem comes from not putting enough of our work out into the world. When you are a professional, you don't get the excuse of writer's block. You have to show up each and every day.

Seth's theory is that as we get in the habit of putting work into the world everyday, we will slowly begin to produce better work.

> The only way to write a great play is to keep writing, to show up, and put the work on the table.

**My goal with the challenge is simple: to show up each and every day, to keep writing, and to put the code on the table.**
